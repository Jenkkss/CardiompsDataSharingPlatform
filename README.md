# To set up, you must follow a few simple steps, make sure you have followed the git instructions below...
# ...assuming that you have switched to the develop branch, you may follow the three instructions below:
# 1. Once the repo has been cloned, open the project and type "cd client" to change directories
# 2. Type "npm install" to install all the dependencies
# 3. Type "npm serve" to start the client application

# Useful Git Commands for collaborating:
# 1. Switch to the develop branch, or your newly created branch and "git pull origin develop" to stay up to date
# 2. Once that is done, create a new branch and switch to it by typing "git checkout -b feature-branch"
# 3. Work on your feature and once finished, "git add ." and "git commit -m "message goes here""
# 4. Now push by typing "git push origin "your branch name goes here, in this case feature-b""
